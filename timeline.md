TIMELINE
========
##### Constructive Placer will be done by 22/7
##### Provisions tasks will be done hand in hand with the constructive placer, what is left after the constructive placer will take probably 2 days of writing so probably at 24/7
##### What is left of the Document Tasks will be done by 23/7 as a lot of the document tasks will be done when implementing the constructive placer
##### To be discussed later : DEF viewer

WORK DIVISION
=============
for both the examples provisions and documentation tasks, each of us will handle half 
the number of the tasks
We will decice on the components in the design of the placer at 4 pm (most probably) and then will be dividing the tasks ( components implementation ) equally between us (based on the number of tasks)
